# My Little Library
This project invites the user to explore a list of books from the Harry Potter series. This list has the title of the book, the author, a book cover and a button that allows the book to be added to a "My Books" list. The "My Books" list holds all the chosen books that the user would like to read including the same book info from the browse page.
